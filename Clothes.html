      <p> The Queen always has a beautiful outfit for almost every occasion. she gets her colorful ensembles of clothing custom by designer Angela Kelly. She usually pairs her clothing with her signature black Launer handbag.
        <br>
        For her shoes she usually wears Anello &amp; Davide loafers and on a sunny day she wears a beautiful boater hat to protect her from the sun. Even though the queens clothes are amazing, were sure that she would look just as beautiful in the clothes of a poor woman.
